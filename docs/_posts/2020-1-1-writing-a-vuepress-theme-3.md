summary: quick checklist for future proof content

How is extensibility in future-proof content to be understood?  
  
If I can quickly add information to the already published content and publish it to all channels on schedule without breaking any frontend design. I can therefore claim that content is extendable.  
  
Checklist for extensibility  
ðŸ–‹ Well define the content model  
ðŸ–‹ Semantic understanding and categorization of content  
ðŸ–‹ UI Independent  
  
If I am missing anything please drop your comments. I am looking forward to learning from you.
