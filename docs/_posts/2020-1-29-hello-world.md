summary: Checklist for structured content

---
A checklist to identify your content is structured  
  
1\. You have well-defined content model to capture the content  
 2. Create once, publish anywhere  
3\. Technical stack agnostic  
4\. Re-use  
  
Am I missing any other point which identifies that content is structured then please drop in the comment?
